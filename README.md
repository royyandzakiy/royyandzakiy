# 👋 Hi, I’m Royyan

Senior Embedded / Firmware Engineer  
C++ • RTOS • Zephyr • ESP-IDF • Systems Architecture

I design and build **reliable embedded systems** — from bare-metal and RTOS firmware to device-to-desktop tooling — with a focus on **clarity, determinism, and long-term maintainability**.

Mostly an **individual contributor by default**, occasionally stepping into **technical leadership** when systems, teams, or architectures need alignment.

---

## 🧠 How I approach engineering

- Systems should be **understandable before they are clever**
- Event-driven > tangled control flow
- Explicit state beats implicit behavior
- Tooling and architecture are part of the product
- Production constraints are design inputs, not afterthoughts

I care less about novelty and more about whether a system can be **debugged at 2 a.m. and still make sense**.

---

## 🔧 What I work on

- Embedded firmware for **IoT, medical, and industrial devices**
- RTOS-based systems (Zephyr, FreeRTOS)
- Connectivity-heavy devices (BLE, Wi-Fi, MQTT)
- Sensor data pipelines under real-time constraints
- Firmware architecture, refactoring, and developer tooling
- Native desktop tooling (Windows) for device communication and diagnostics

---

## 🧰 Core technologies

**Languages**
- C / Modern C++
- Python (tooling, scripting)
- TypeScript (automation, internal tools)

**Embedded & Systems**
- Zephyr OS, FreeRTOS
- ESP-IDF, Nordic SDK
- State machines, event-driven design
- Low-power and high-throughput data paths

**Connectivity**
- BLE, Wi-Fi
- MQTT
- Custom binary protocols

**Tooling**
- CMake
- CI/CD for firmware
- Static analysis
- GoogleTest

## 📌 Selected repositories

These repos reflect how I think about **architecture, tooling, and correctness** rather than polished products.

### 🧩 Embedded & Systems
- **[multisensor-station](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/multisensor-station)**  
  Modular multi-sensor firmware architecture focused on extensibility and reliability.

- **[esp-freertos-tutorial](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/esp-freertos-tutorial)**  
  Practical FreeRTOS patterns on ESP32, focused on task structure and concurrency clarity.

- **[zephyr-modern-cpp](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/zephyr-modern-cpp)**  
  Exploring modern C++ usage within Zephyr constraints — experimental by design.

- **[LoRa-RHMesh](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/LoRa-RHMesh)**  
  Early work on LoRa mesh networking and packet routing concepts.

### 🧰 Tooling & Architecture
- **[windows-lib-cpp-template](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/windows-lib-cpp-template)**  
  A production-oriented C++ library template with structured CMake, CI, and native Windows integration.  
  (Used internally in real projects.)

- **[balancer-robot-workspace-manifest](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/balancer-robot-workspace-manifest)**  
  Zephyr + west workspace manifest for a balancing robot project.  
  Still a work in progress — intended as a long-term systems portfolio.

### 🧪 C++ Experiments
- **[gmock-sfinae-concepts-calculator](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/gmock-sfinae-concepts-calculator)**  
  Small experiments around templates, SFINAE, concepts, and testability.

## 🧭 What you won’t find here

- Shiny demos without constraints
- Over-engineered abstractions
- “One weird trick” architectures
- Framework worship

Most projects here exist to **clarify thinking**, test assumptions, or support real work.

## 📍 Currently

- Embedded Software Engineer at **LMesh IoT**  
- Working on medical and industrial IoT systems using Zephyr, FreeRTOS, and mixed-connectivity stacks
- Based in the Netherlands (remote-friendly)
