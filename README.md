# Hi, I’m Royyan

Senior Embedded / Firmware Engineer  
C++ • RTOS • Zephyr • ESP-IDF • Systems Architecture

I work on embedded systems that need to behave predictably in the real world.  
From bare-metal and RTOS firmware to device-to-desktop tooling, I focus on designs that are explicit, debuggable, and maintainable over time.

Primarily an individual contributor. I step into technical leadership when architecture, direction, or system boundaries need clarification.

---

## How I think about engineering

- Code should be understandable before it is clever
- Explicit state and data flow beat implicit behavior
- Event-driven designs scale better than tightly coupled control logic
- Tooling, build systems, and developer experience matter
- Production constraints are part of the design, not something added later

I enjoy experimenting with language features and abstractions, but I am always aware of the trade-offs, especially in embedded systems.

---

## What I work on

- Embedded firmware for IoT, medical, and industrial devices
- RTOS-based systems using Zephyr and FreeRTOS
- Connectivity-heavy devices using BLE, Wi-Fi, and MQTT
- Sensor data acquisition under real-time and throughput constraints
- Firmware architecture, refactoring, and system cleanup
- Native Windows tooling for device communication and diagnostics

## Core technologies

**Languages**
- C and Modern C++
- Python for tooling and scripting
- TypeScript for automation and internal tools

**Embedded and Systems**
- Zephyr OS, FreeRTOS
- ESP-IDF, Nordic SDK
- State machines and event-driven designs
- Low-power systems and high-rate data paths

**Connectivity**
- BLE, Wi-Fi
- MQTT
- Custom binary protocols

**Tooling**
- CMake
- CI/CD for firmware projects
- Static analysis
- GoogleTest

## Selected repositories

These repositories are mostly explorations of architecture, language features, or tooling choices. Some are experimental by design.

### Embedded and Systems
- **[multisensor-station](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/multisensor-station)**  
  Modular multi-sensor firmware architecture focused on extensibility and clear separation of concerns.

- **[esp-freertos-tutorial](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/esp-freertos-tutorial)**  
  Practical FreeRTOS patterns on ESP32, with an emphasis on task structure and concurrency clarity.

- **[zephyr-modern-cpp](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/zephyr-modern-cpp)**  
  Experiments using modern C++ features on Zephyr and ESP-IDF, including concepts, variants, and alternative state machine approaches.

- **[LoRa-RHMesh](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/LoRa-RHMesh)**  
  Early work around LoRa mesh networking and packet routing.

### Tooling and Architecture
- **[windows-lib-cpp-template](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/windows-lib-cpp-template)**  
  A C++ library template with structured CMake, CI, and native Windows integration.  
  Used internally in real projects.

- **[balancer-robot-workspace-manifest](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/balancer-robot-workspace-manifest)**  
  Zephyr and west workspace setup for a balancing robot project.  
  Still a work in progress and intended as a long-term portfolio system.

- **[gmock-sfinae-concepts-calculator](https://github.com/royyandzakiy/gmock-sfinae-concepts-calculator)**  
  Small experiments around templates, SFINAE, C++20 concepts, and testability.

## What you probably will not see here

- Shiny demos without real constraints
- Over-abstracted architectures
- Framework-driven designs without justification
- Claims of “best” solutions

Most of these projects exist to explore ideas, validate assumptions, or support real work.

## Currently

- Embedded Software Engineer at **LMesh IoT**
- Working on medical and industrial IoT systems using Zephyr, FreeRTOS, and mixed connectivity stacks
- Based in the Netherlands, working remotely

If you enjoy thinking about firmware architecture, trade-offs, and how things actually behave on hardware, we will likely have things to talk about.
